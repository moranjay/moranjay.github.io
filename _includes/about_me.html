            I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
